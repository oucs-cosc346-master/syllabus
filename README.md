## Course Description

In this class we will be learning about Object-Oriented Programming and User
Interfaces. Although the ideas apply across platforms, we will focus on
software development for the Mac. We will be using Swift and the Xcode
development environment. We will learn how to use the Foundation Framework for
general purpose programming and the Application Kit Framework for application
development. Along the way we will cover object-oriented design and user
interface guidelines. At the end of the class you should understand how to
write object-oriented code, why it is good for graphical user interfaces, and
how to write and design applications for OS X on the Mac.

## Labs

The labs a where the majority of the practical work. While they're not assessed
individually, you will find the assignments much easier to complete if you
concientiously attend and put effort in.

## Projects

There are two projects, the first is about object oriented design and the
second is about user interface design. More details will be released in due
course.
